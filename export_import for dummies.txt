Import Export Class Constructor Method

Modules are used for splitting the code for a more manageable structure. 
The main javascript file will contain only the imports from the modules folder, where the javascript files lie, containing the different classes. 
After each class there will be an export, sending the code away, where it will be picked up by the import on the main javascript file.

There are different exports and imports:

export function example(){	}

this will have the following import:

Import {example} from './modules';

*Notice the curly brackets for the function.

AND


class Example() {	}

export default Example;


With the following import


Import Example from './modules';

*Notice that the class doesnt require curly brackets as the function.

 

A class contains a constructor and methods. The methods can be written, but will not be run until they are called inside the constructor.

For dummies: Imagine you want to make a cake. You have the ingredients, the instructions and yourself. The ingredients will not mix themselves. 
The instructions will not follow themselves. You need to mix the ingredients following the instructions in order to make the cake.

In this instance you are the constructor, and the ingredients and the instructions are the methods.
